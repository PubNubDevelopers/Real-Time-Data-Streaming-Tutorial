# Tutorial: Real-Time Data Streaming with PubNub

**PubNub makes it easy to connect and consume huge amounts of real-time streaming data, and deliver it to any number of subscribers.** These "firehoses of data" could be weather reports, business metrics, stock quotes, tweets - really any source of data that is constantly changing and emitting updates. PubNub’s Data Stream Network handles keeping both publishers and subscribers securely connected and ensuring that every piece of data is generally available in real time, so scale (or the amount of data you’re sending) is never an issue.
